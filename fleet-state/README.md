# Fleet State

This utility, `./fleet-state.sh`, will show the current state of a fleet in a CircleCI server 3.x installation.
Looking at the Nomad fleet and the VMs from vm-service, we can determine how much space is actively available.

Coming Soon: support for runner

## Syntax

`./fleet-state.sh <namespace>`
